    <h1>Merry Christmas Love</h1>
    <p>I'm sorry I couldn't give you what I originally planned, but i decided that this would be a good present too.</p>
    <p>My original present was going to be a music box type of thing that I created, and when you pressed a button it would play a song you downloaded on there.</p>
    <p>I had it all wired up and disassembled a headphone for a speaker, why I was looking for a small speaker at goodwill, but when I went to code it. I didn't have my wire to connect my computer and the board.</p>
    <p>However this pairs nicely with the flowers you'll be getting with this if you ask me</p>
    <h2>Pictures of Us and what they mean to me</h2>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/PrefFavoritePhoto.JPG" alt="My Favorite" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>There is no shock when I tell you this is my favorite photo of us. It captures the joy and connection we share in a way that I can't help but smile every time I see it. I love having that photo as my lock screen and, will occasionally stare at it because you look so good in it.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/FormalYelling.JPEG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>This is a photo I think is hilarous but I love so much! It really captures how much fun we have together and how we can be so silly with each other. It is fun to look back on and see how much fun we have with each other, even in just photos.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/Holding@Soccer.jpeg" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>This photo just looks absolutely beautiful. The sunset, and most importantly, you! It was so much fun being able to watch you play soccer, and I wish I could've seen you play more! I look forward to watching you play in the next alumni game, and I will be yelling even louder next time.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/Carry.JPG" alt="Halloweekend Pt1" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>This night was so much fun with you. Going to beta and having you really meet the people in my chapter, before you knew everyone. Seeing you get along with everyone was such a good feeling! It showed me that you are the person for me and liked the same people/things I did. I knew you were the one for me.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/NotBasic.jpeg" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>I think this photo is so funny. You aren't no basic bitch you deserve triangles. I will say he was right you aren't basic. You are special, there isn't anyone that I have ever met that is like you. You are so sweet and kind, there isn't anyone better than you. I can't wait to see you continue not to be basic.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/IceSkating.JPG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>Ice skating with you was so romantic, teaching you how to skate. Holding your hand while you were still trying to catch your balance. It was so much fun being able to teach you, and seeing you finally get the hang of it! I felt so happy for you, and seeing you have so much fun!</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/FormalLooking.JPEG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>This photo just hits me differently, I love taking photos with you and when we look at each other. You can really see the love in our eyes and how much we care for each other. I know no matter how old we get we will forever have that look for each other, and I can't wait to see the photos as we get older!</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/PumpkinPatch.JPG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>Going to the pumpkin patch with you was so much fun! I loved going to hubers with you! Walking around, taking pictures, picking out pumpkins, and looking around the gift shop! I do wish I got a better bottle than we did, but still its something that will remind of us of that day! I'm sorry we never got time to carve the pumpkins, and that my rotted so bad. I think next time I'll let you inspect my pumpkin to make sure I picked the right one.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/GatlinBerg.JPEG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>I wish I was able to remember this night, but it looks like we were having a blast. I honestly don't know what to say about it other than how much fun we were having! Even if I was in a different mindstate at the time.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/HoldingFromBehind.jpeg" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>This was one of our first photos together. It really hits me hard to think of the progress we went through together. We were still getting to know each other, but you can tell that we felt so comfortable with each other. The innocent love that we had for each other, even before we knew we loved each other.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/SkinGraft.JPG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>I know this was such a rough time for you, not being able to eat properly and being in so much pain. During this time it proved to me that I could care for you, and accommodate to your needs. After that week I knew I could perservere anything with you, and make sure that you are okay. It showed me that I would do anything for you wether it range from eating soup all week to being able to keep you comforted in times of distress.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/FormalKissing.JPEG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>I love tkaing photos of us kissing, I know you think its awkward but I cherish these photos so much! I believe they show the love we have so much, only a hair behind the photos of us looking at each other right before we kiss. I love kissing you so much, and you are so good at it. You make my heart skip a beat every time that we kiss no matter if it's just a peck. </p>

      <img src="../Pictures/Kaylee&I/SnowUs.JPG" alt="The Yell" width="240" height="320" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
      <p>Being out in the snow with you for the first time was so much fun! You looked so gorgeous! The snow really looks good on you, and reminded me of a hallmark movie when the two love intrests are in the snow, and they can't stop looking at each other! It felt like a movie moment came true.</p>
    </div>    
    <p>Sadly I can't put in the first photo of us together, but I want to tell you about it. I know we joke about how in trance I look listening to you, but theres more to that photo then you understand. Yes I was in trance listening to you, but you could see from day one that I will care and cherish you. I knew you for less than an hour and I had already fell head over heels for you. Who knew a simple cringy pick up line on tinder would leave to something so sweet and beautiful! I wouldn't change a single thing about us, and to this day I still look at you like this. The same fascination looking at you to this day, and that will never change!</p>
    <h2>Merry Christmas Love!</h2>
    <h1>I'm sorry I couldn't make that music box for you, but I believe this is a more heartfelt gift than that. I love you so very much, and I can't wait to grow old with you!</h1>
