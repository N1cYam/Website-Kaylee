    <p>Hey Baby sorry that I haven't been on top of this website for a while. I should be updating it more regularly, I just need to get in a rythm and I should be good. I can't wait to enjoy this last semester with you, it's already been a great start, and I've already enjoyed every second with you already! I love you so very much!</p>
