    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Monday</h2>
    <p>Hey baby, I know it's only been a week since I've seen you, but this has been the lonest week ever it feels like. It sucks that the weather keeps getting bad the day before we see eachother. I can't wait to see you this Saturday. I miss you so very much. I love you!!!</p>
    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <p>One day away from seeing you and I am so excited!! Its been too long since I've seen you! But, when I see you tomorrow the wait will have been worth it! I love you so very much my love!</p>
