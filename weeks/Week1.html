    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Monday</h2>
    <p>Hey baby, I know it's only been a week since I've seen you, but this has been the lonest week ever it feels like. It sucks that the weather keeps getting bad the day before we see eachother. I can't wait to see you this Saturday. I miss you so very much. I love you!!!</p>
    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <p>One day away from seeing you and I am so excited!! Its been too long since I've seen you! But, when I see you tomorrow the wait will have been worth it! I love you so very much my love!</p>
    <h2>Wednesday</h2>
    <p>I had such a great time with you today my love! It was so good to see you and that made the wait so worth it! It was so much fun going thrifting with you, and grabbing a bite to eat! I wish I could've stayed there longer with you. My heart was aching when I left because I wont see you for another couple of days. I am so excited about seeing you on Saturday, and being with you! I love you more than you could ever imagine!</p>
    <h2>Thursday</h2>
    <p>Only two days away from seeing you, sorry I kept the website locked down until Saturday. I didn't want you to see the Christmas page until you saw it in person! I love you so very much!</p>
    <h2>Friday</h2>
    <p>One day to go baby! I can't explain to you how much I am looking forward to seeing you! I'm sorry I've been so closed off these past two days, I've just had to do quite a bit of learning for the Christmas Page, it was more difficult and I sadly couldn't do everything I wanted to do with it. I can't wait to see how these week updates get better with every passing week, as I continue to show and tell you how much I love you!</p>
